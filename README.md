CEC300 Navigation Project

A quadcopter is located at latitude 29.401325 and longitude -81.177222 the quadrotor is oriented so
that the y axis is aligned with north/south and the x axis is aligned with east/west. Positive accelerations
on the y axis are towards the north and positive accelerations on the x axis are towards the east. Time is
in seconds and the acceleration data units are cm/sec^2.

The data is contained in the file quad_accel.xlsx When the data starts, the quadrotor x velocity is -0.2
m/s and the y velocity is 0.44 m/s

The data was taken every 100ms. The accelerometer data is in the file quad_accel_data.xlsx.

Using the acceleration data you are determine the position of the quadcopter at every measurement,
convert the position to GPS coordinates, and then plot the flight path on a map of the earth so that the
location of the flight is clearly visible.
